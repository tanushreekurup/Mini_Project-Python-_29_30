Whatever you are,be a good one.
Wouldn't it be lovely to enjoy a week soaking up the culture?
The question isn’t who is going to let me; it’s who is going to stop me.
War does not bring anything good to the common people.
If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door.
Be the change,you wish to see in the world.
Don’t find fault, find a remedy.
Everything you’ve ever wanted is on the other side of fear.
